	<h1>An ORB in The Lua Language</h1>

	<p>OiL stands for ORB in <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, an open-source free scripting language that has been calling more and more attention from IT community each day. Many applications worldwide are currently using Lua for different purposes, both commercially and academically. OiL is intended to be an object request broker that shares many of the characteristics of Lua like simplicity, flexibility and portability. The project is still very new, therefore many different aspects that must be addressed are still missing.</p>
	<p>Currently, OiL supports only part of the <a href="http://www.corba.org/">CORBA</a> specification. Although, it is intended to provide seamless support for many different ORB protocols. One of the main concerns of the OiL team is to maintain its implementation simple and lightweight, therefore some more advanced features of CORBA may not be supported or be replaced by features of the Lua language.</p>

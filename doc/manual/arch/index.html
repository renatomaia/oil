<p>OiL is a component-based framework for implementation of ORBs in Lua.
It is entirely implemented using <a href="http://loop.luaforge.net/manual/components.html">LOOP's component models</a>.
The OiL framework defines both an abstract component architecture and a set of standard classes that implement the components of this architecture.
Such classes are implemented using <a href="http://loop.luaforge.net/manual/models.html">LOOP's class models</a>.
Typically, OiL is extended or customized by changes to this architecture or by the use of new classes in component implementations.</p>

<h2><a name="layers">Architectural Layers</a></h2>

<p>OiL's internal architecture is defined in layers.
A layer defines a set of components and their connections.
A <em>complementary layer</em> is a layer that defines connections to components from another layer.
An <em>extension layer</em> is a layer that redefines components of other layer with new ports, new connections, or new implementations.</p>

<p>In the most basic level, OiL's standard architecture defines two complementary layers: the <%=link("Core","core layer","#base")%> and a <%=link("RMI","RMI layer")%>.
The core layer defines components that implement the programming model provided by OiL, such as the support for brokers, proxies, servants, etc.
Yet, the RMI layer defines components that implement the support for some RMI technology, such as CORBA or LuDO.
Over these base layers some extensions layers are defined to add new features or provide alternative implementations.</p>

<p>OiL's standard distribution provides one core layer (<%=link("Core","base","#base")%>) and two extension layers over it that add support for <%=link"Threads"%> (<%=link("Core","cooperative","#cooperative")%>) and typed invocations (<%=link("Core","typed","#typed")%>).
Additionally, this distribution also provides two alternative RMI layers (<%=link("RMI","corba","#corba")%> and <%=link("RMI","ludo","#ludo")%>).
Finally, two extensions layers over the CORBA's RMI layer are provided to add support for invocation interception (<%=link("RMI","intercepted","#intercepted")%>) and marshaling code generation (<%=link("RMI","gencode","#gencode")%>).</p>

<h2>Broker Façade</h2>

<p>Usually, OiL's components are not directly accessed by the application.
Instead, the services provided by these components are accessed through <em>brokers</em>.
<%=link("Brokers","Brokers")%> are objects that encapsulate an entire assembly of components that compose an ORB instance and provide a simple and integrated interface for the services provided.
Nevertheless, the components encapsulated by brokers are accessible as fields of the broker object, where the name of the field is the name of the component in OiL's architecture.
See sections <%=link"Core"%> and <%=link"RMI"%> for an overview of OiL's architecture.
The component instances used by a broker are provided at its initialization or are created accordingly to the defined flavor.
For more information about broker initialization and flavors see sections <%=link"Brokers"%> and <%=link"Flavors"%>, respectively.</p>

<p>OiL also provides module <code>oil.compat</code>, which is an alternative façade that provides features similar to those provided by brokers.
In fact, this module implements the interface of previous versions of OiL.</p>

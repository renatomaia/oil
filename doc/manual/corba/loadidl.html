<p>All the CORBA support provided by OiL is based on interface and typing information.
OiL stores all this information in a internal type repository, which implements a CORBA Interface Repository.
Once an IDL interface definition is stored in this repository, OiL is able to create servants and proxies with that interface.
OiL provides three ways to load an interface or type, as described below.</p>

<h2>IDL Specifications</h2>

<p>The most common way to load interface definitions is to load an IDL specification using method <%=link("Brokers","<code>loadidl</code>","#loadidl")%><code>(idlspec)</code> e <%=link("Brokers","<code>loadidlfile</code>","#loadidlfile")%><code>(filepath)</code> of CORBA brokers.
In this case, the IDL specification is parsed to produce descriptions that are stored in the internal type repository, as illustrated in the example below.</p>

<pre>
require "oil"

oil.main(function()
	local broker = oil.init()
	
	broker:loadidl[[
		interface Hello {
			void say();
		};
	]]
	
	broker:writeto("hello.ior",
		broker:tostring(
			broker:newservant(hello, nil, "Hello")))
	broker:run()
end)
</pre>

<h2>Remote Interface Repository</h2>

<p>An alternative to the use of IDL specifications is to acquire the interface definition from a remote CORBA Interface Repository (IR) that already contains them.
This can be done by method <%=link("Brokers","<code>setIR</code>","#setIR")%><code>(ir_proxy)</code> of CORBA brokers.
This method receives as argument an OiL proxy to the remote IR.
Whenever OiL finds the name of a interface or type that it does not known, it then checks this remote IR and reads the definition.
However, this is only done for the first time.
Once OiL learns about an interface, it does not read its definition again, even if the original definition changes in the remote IR.
The code below shows how to setup the remote IR.</p>

<pre>
require "oil"

oil.main(function()
	local broker = oil.init()
	
	-- create proxy for a CORBA IR
	-- and set it as the remote IR
	broker:setIR(       
		broker:newproxy(  
			oil.readfrom("ir.ior")))
	
	broker:writeto("hello.ior",
		broker:tostring(
			broker:newservant(hello, nil, "Hello")))
	broker:run()
end)</pre>

<p>CORBA brokers also provide the method <%=link("Brokers","<code>getIR</code>","#getIR")%><code>()</code> to get the current remote IR being used.
Furthermore, the OiL's internal type repository also implements the CORBA IR interface, therefore, all interface and type definitions can be accessed remotely by CORBA IR clients.
In particular, another CORBA broker can be configured to retrieve definition from the internal type repository of another CORBA broker.
To get the servant of the internal IR, use method <%=link("Brokers","<code>getLIR</code>","#getLIR")%><code>()</code> of CORBA brokers.</p>

<h2>Lua Constructors</h2>

<p>Finally, another way to provide interface and type descriptions is to create them using the constructors provided by module <code>oil.corba.idl</code> and register them in the internal IR.
For a description of these constructors, check section <%=link"Mapping"%>.
The code below shows how to create and register descriptions of the <code>Hello</code> interface in the internal type repository.</p>

<pre>
require "oil"

oil.main(function()
	local idl = require "oil.corba.idl"
	local broker = oil.init()
	
	broker.types:put(
		idl.interface{
			defintions = {
				say = idl.operation(),
			}
		}
	)
	
	broker:writeto("hello.ior",
		broker:tostring(
			broker:newservant(hello, nil, "Hello")))
	broker:run()
end)
</pre>

This is OiL 0.3.4 alpha release.

* Installation
  ------------
  Building OiL on a Unix system should be very easy:

        1. Read "config" and edit it to suit your platform and needs.
        2. Do "make".
        3. If you want to install OiL in an "official" place in your system,
           then do "make install". The official place and the way to install
           files are defined in "config". You may have to be root to do this.

  Building OiL on a Windows system may be very similar with NMAKE utility:

        1. Read "config.win32" and edit it to suit your platform and needs.
           To build the dynamic link libraries, you should uncomment the
           lines described in "config.win32", but define the correct compiler
           parameter to use the allocation library suited to your application.
        2. Do "NMAKE /f Makefile.win32".
        3. If you want to install OiL in an "official" place in your system,
           then do "NMAKE /f install". The official place and the way to
           install files are defined in "config.win32".

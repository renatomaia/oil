This is OiL 0.5 release.

* Installation
  ------------
  Building OiL on Unix systems should be very easy:

        1. Read "config" and edit it to suit your platform and needs.
        2. Pick one of the platforms that better suits you and do "make <plat>".
        3. If you want to install OiL in an "official" place in your system,
           then do "make install". The official place and the way to install
           files are defined in "config". You may have to be root to do this.

OiL 0.5 beta

[New Features]

- Object map is an usual Lua table that can manipulated by the application to
  implement different servant management policies [demo objectmap].
- CORBA interceptors can forward the invocation to an alternative reference,
  both in the client or server side.
- Support to define paths to search for included IDL files.
- LuDO support for parameter passing by reference.
- New flavor 'lua' that enables special proxies that delegate their meta-method
  to their servants (for LuDO by reference only).
- General interception mechanism (works for CORBA, LuDO or any other protocol).

[Improved Features]

- New API:
  - orb:newproxy(ref, ['synchronous','asynchronous','protected'], type)
  - orb:setinterceptor(iceptor, 'corba')
  - orb:setinterceptor(iceptor, 'corba.server')
  - orb:setinterceptor(iceptor, 'corba.client')
- New interceptor implementation with more information and more about the call.
- New ORB assembler and builder scripts and simplification of field 'flavor'.
- Interface parameter (3rd) of 'newservant' now overwrites field '__type' of
  the servant's implementation.

[Deprecated Features]

- Pseudo-method 'proxy:_narrow()' is deprecated in favor of 'orb:narrow(proxy)'
- Module 'oil.compat' was removed.

[Bug Fixes]

- Bugfix in processing of forward declarations in IDLs.
- Bugfix to invoke interceptors when exceptions are raised.
- Bugfix to prevent that marshal errors stops the 'orb:run()' method.
- Bugfix when unknown repIDs are imported from a remote IR.
- Bugfix to 'idl2lua.lua' script raise errors when there are problems with the
  contents of the IDL file.

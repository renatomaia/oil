OiL 0.4 alpha

[New Features]

- Deferred calls (aka "futures") [demo deferred];
- ORB shutdown operation [demo selfcall];
- CORBA request interception [demo interceptors];
- Customizable component-based architecture [see 'oil.assemble' function];
- IDL large numbers: long long, unsigned long long, long double [see config];
	NOTE: Lua must be changed so lua_Number is 'long double'.

[Improved Features]

Application fa√ßade:
	oil.VERSION
	oil.types                    -- improved alternative to oil.getLIR()
	oil.tasks                    -- instead of scheduler
	oil.tostring(object)         -- instead of obj:_ior()
	oil.deactivate(obj|key|impl) -- improved alternative to obj:_deactivate()
	oil.sleep(time)              -- instead of scheduler.sleep(time)
	oil.pcall(func, ...)         -- instead of scheduler.pcall(func, ...)
	oil.time()                   -- alternative to socket.gettime()
	oil.main(func)               -- instead of scheduler.new(func, ...); scheduler.run()
	oil.newthread(func, ...)     -- instead of scheduler.start(func, ...)
	oil.newencoder()
	oil.newdecoder(string)
	oil.newexcept(body)          -- alternative to oil.Exception(body)
	oil.setexcatch(func, type)
	oil.shutdown()
	oil.writeto(file, text)      -- similar to oil.writeIOR(obj, file)
	oil.readfrom(file)           -- instead of oil.readIOR(file)
	oil.setclientinterceptor(iceptor)
	oil.setserverinterceptor(iceptor)
Integrated CORBA IR:
	- Ability to change IR definitions;
	- Ability to load module parts using different 'oil.loadidl*' calls;
	- Consistent storage of all IDL definitions, not only interfaces;
	- Ability to import any definition from the remote delegated IR (oil.setIR);
GIOP implementation:
	- Support for marshaling of typecode 'null' and anys containing values of type
	  'null';
	- 'nil' values used as 'any' are automatically coded as 'null';
	- Any's now provide the field _anytype to identify the IDL type of the value;
	- Automatic reconnections when connection is closed. WARNING: Operation
	  invocation may be issued many times if no reply is sent (no at-most-once
	  guarantees);
Proxies:
	- 'oil.narrow' and 'proxy:_narrow' now accepts any valid interface
	  specification, i.e. repID, absoulute name, IDL descriptor, or remote IR
	  object;
	- The function used to handle exceptions can be defined for all proxies of a
	  given interface by function 'oil.setexcatch(handler [, interface])'.
	  If no interface is provided then the handler is set for all proxies.
	  Previously, this handler could only be set for individual proxies by field
	  '__exceptions';
	- Now, if the exception handler function returns (i.e. not raise a Lua error)
	  then the exception is ignored and the values returned are used as the
	  results of the invocation that raised in the original exception;
	  Addition of 'oil.deactivate(<corbaobj | implobj | objkey> [, interface])'
	  that removes an object from the ORB;
Servants:
	- Automatically generated object keys start with '\0' to provide a way for the
	  application to avoid collisions with defined keys;
	- A single Lua object can be used as implementation of different CORBA objects
	  created with automatic keys as long as they implement different interfaces
	  because object keys now contains the interface descriptor hash-code.
	  WARN: Each time a Lua object is used as an object with a different interface
	  a new CORBA object is created for each interface, which will be the actual
	  (i.e. most specific) interface of the new CORBA object. To avoid implicit
	  creation of different CORBA objects with different interfaces for a simgle
	  Lua object, set the '__idltype' field of the objet meta-table (i.e. its
	  class) to the interface (repID, absolute name, IDL descriptor, or remote IR
	  object) that should be used;
	- The interface of an implicitly created CORBA object can also be defined by
	  field '__idltype' of the object implementation itself (in older versions,
	  only the '__idltype' field of the metatable could be used);
Verbose support:
	- Prints parameter values and objects;
	- New level distribution:
		1: Operation invocation and dispatching;
		2: GIOP request and reply processing;
		3: Mutual exclusion channel access (concurrent mode);
		4: GIOP message creation and handling (i.e. requests and replies);
		5: Socket channels creation and handling (i.e. connection and transport);
		6: Value (un)marshaling;
		7: Hexadecimal view of marshaled streams;
		8: Creation of IDL descriptors and internal IR operation;
Development support
	- Utility script to create Lua scripts that feed the internal IR with
	  descriptions described in IDL files.
	- Unix shell scripts for execution of demos.

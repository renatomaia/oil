OiL 0.5

[New Features]

- Object map is an usual Lua table that can manipulated by the application to
  implement different servant management policies [demo objectmap].
- CORBA interceptors can forward the invocation to an alternative reference,
  both in the client or server side.
- Support to define file paths for search of IDL files defined used '#include'.
- LuDO support for parameter passing by reference.
- New flavor 'lua' that enables special proxies that delegate their meta-method
  to their servants (for LuDO by reference only).
- General interception mechanism (works for CORBA, LuDO or any other protocol).

[Improved Features]

- New API:
  - orb:newproxy(ref/proxy, ['synchronous'|'asynchronous'|'protected'], [type])
  - orb:setinterceptor(iceptor, 'corba')
- New interceptor implementation that provides more information about the call.
- New ORB assembler and builder scripts and simplification of field 'flavor'.
- Interface parameter (3rd) of 'newservant' now overwrites field '__type' of
  the servant's implementation.

[Removed/Deprecated Features]

- Module 'oil.compat' is no more available.
- Alternative proxies ('__deferred' and '__try') are not created automatically.
  Instead, use the following commands to explicitly create such proxies whenever
  necessary.
    local deferred = orb:newproxy(proxy, "asynchronous")
    local try      = orb:newproxy(proxy, "protected")
- Pseudo-method 'proxy:_narrow([iface])' is deprecated in favor of
  'orb:narrow(proxy, [iface])' or 'orb:newproxy(proxy, [kind], [iface])'
- Operation 'orb:setclientinterceptor(iceptor)' is deprecated in favor of
  'orb:setinterceptor(iceptor, "corba.client")'
- Operation 'orb:setserverinterceptor(iceptor)' is deprecated in favor of
  'orb:setinterceptor(iceptor, "corba.server")'

[Bug Fixes]

- Bugfix in processing of forward declarations in IDLs.
- Bugfix to invoke interceptors when exceptions are raised.
- Bugfix to prevent '_non_existent' to raise exceptions like 'COMM_FAILURE'.
- Bugfix to prevent that marshal errors stop the 'orb:run()' method.
- Bugfix to prevent that invocation parameters marshal errors cause memory leak.
- Bugfix in marshalling of TypeCode/Anys that used CDR indirection.
- Bugfix when unknown repIDs are imported from a remote IR.
- Bugfix to make 'idl2lua.lua' script raise errors when there are problems with
  the contents of the IDL file.
